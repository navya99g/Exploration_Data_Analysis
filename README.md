# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊🔍  

## Introduction  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data science that helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize key characteristics of a dataset. This repository contains various EDA projects covering different domains, including **global happiness, hotel bookings, and the Titanic disaster**.  

## Projects 🚀  

### 1️⃣ **World Happiness Analysis (EDA) 🌍😊**  
This project explores the **World Happiness Report 2019** to identify factors affecting happiness across different countries.  

🔹 **Key Insights**:  
- Higher **GDP per capita**, **social support**, and **healthy life expectancy** are positively correlated with happiness.  
- Countries in **North America, Australia, and Europe** score higher in happiness compared to **Asia and Africa**.  
- Visualizations include **happiness distribution, GDP correlation, and global happiness maps**.

### 2️⃣ **Hotel Booking Analysis (EDA) 🏨📊**  
This project examines **hotel booking data** to analyze booking trends, customer behavior, and cancellation rates.  

🔹 **Key Insights**:  
- **City Hotels** have a **higher cancellation rate** than Resort Hotels.  
- **Families with children** prefer Resort Hotels.  
- **Peak booking months** occur in **July and August**.

### 3️⃣ **Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA) 🚢⚓**  
This project explores survival patterns in the **Titanic dataset**, analyzing how factors like gender, class, and age influenced survival rates.  

🔹 **Key Insights**:  
- **Women had a 74% survival rate**, while **men had only 19%**.  
- **First-class passengers** had a **higher chance of survival (63%)** than those in third-class (24%).  
- **Children (0-12 years)** had better survival rates than adults.  
- **Passengers who paid higher fares** were more likely to survive.

## Tools Used 🔧  
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Chi-square tests, correlation analysis  
- **Visualization**: Count plots, heatmaps, box plots, regression plots  

## Next Steps 📈  
- Expand **trend analysis** across multiple datasets.  
- Implement **predictive modeling** in another repository [(Predictive Analysis )](https://github.com/navya99g/Predictive_Analysis_Models/tree/main).  
- Conduct **hypothesis testing** to validate insights.  

## Acknowledgments  
- Datasets sourced from **Kaggle**.  
- Inspired by real-world data science applications.
