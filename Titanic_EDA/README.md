# Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA) ðŸš¢âš“  

## Introduction  
The **Titanic disaster** is one of the most well-known shipwrecks in history. This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to analyze survival patterns, identify key factors influencing survival, and uncover insights using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. Understanding these trends can provide a data-driven perspective on survival determinants like **gender, class, age, fare, and embarkation point**.  

## Objectives  
- âœ… Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values effectively.  
- âœ… Explore **survival distribution** across different demographics.  
- âœ… Analyze how factors like **passenger class, gender, age, and fare** affected survival rates.  
- âœ… Use **visualizations** to communicate insights effectively.  

## Tools Used ðŸ”§  
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`  
- **Statistical Tests**: Chi-square test to determine categorical feature significance.  
- **Environment**: Kaggle Notebook for interactive analysis.  

## Data Overview  
- **Dataset**: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  

## Insights  
âœ… **Survival Overview**:  
   - **38% of passengers survived**, while **62% did not**, showing the tragic scale of the disaster.  

âœ… **Impact of Gender**:  
   - **Women had a significantly higher survival rate** (~74%) compared to men (~19%), supporting the "women and children first" evacuation rule.  

âœ… **Passenger Class Influence**:  
   - **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate (~63%), whereas **third-class passengers** had the lowest (~24%).  

âœ… **Age Distribution & Survival**:  
   - **Children (0-12 years old) had better survival rates**, while survival rates declined for older passengers.  
   - **Seniors (50+) had lower survival chances**, highlighting the advantage of youth.  

âœ… **Embarkation & Fare Impact**:  
   - **Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg ('C') had a higher survival rate** (~55%).  
   - **Higher ticket prices were correlated with increased survival chances**, emphasizing the role of wealth.  

âœ… **Family Size Influence**:  
   - **Large families (5+ members) had a lower survival rate**, suggesting overcrowding or difficulties escaping.

## Statistical Analysis ðŸ“Š  
- **Chi-Square Tests** were conducted for categorical features:  
  - **Sex** (p-value = 0.00000) â†’ **Highly significant**  
  - **Pclass** (p-value = 0.00000) â†’ **Highly significant**  
  - **Embarked** (p-value = 0.00000) â†’ **Significant**  

## Next Steps ðŸš€  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on relationships found in EDA.  
- **Model Selection & Prediction**: Move to a separate repository for predictive modeling.  
- **Survival Probability Modeling**: Train machine learning models to predict survival likelihood.
