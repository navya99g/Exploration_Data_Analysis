# World Happiness Analysis (EDA) 🌍😊

## Introduction  
Happiness is a key indicator of a nation's well-being and quality of life. This project explores the **2019 World Happiness dataset** to uncover patterns in global happiness, identify factors contributing to happiness, and analyze how economic, social, and health indicators impact happiness levels. The insights can assist policymakers in prioritizing efforts to enhance citizens' well-being.

## Key Insights 📊
✅ **Happiness Distribution**:  
   - The most common happiness score across countries is approximately **6**, as seen in the histogram.  

✅ **Economic Prosperity and Happiness**:  
   - Higher **GDP per capita** is strongly correlated with higher happiness scores.  

✅ **Social Support and Happiness**:  
   - Countries with greater **social support** tend to have higher happiness scores, highlighting the role of community and relationships.  

✅ **Health and Longevity**:  
   - Improved **healthy life expectancy** significantly contributes to higher happiness scores.  

✅ **Regional Trends**:  
   - Countries in **Australia, North America, and South America** show higher happiness scores compared to **Asia and Africa**, where scores are generally lower.  

✅ **Multifactor Impact**:  
   - Nations with high **GDP per capita**, **social support**, and **healthy life expectancy** score the highest on the happiness index, emphasizing a balanced approach to economic, social, and health development.
